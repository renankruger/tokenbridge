# Federator deployment

How to deploy it with Docker Compose

### Setup a Google Platform Project and APIs

There's a .env.example file here
- Remove the .example extension;
- You only have to change the variables with {CHANGE};
They are:
- HATHOR_MULTISIG_ORDER: this is the order your federator stands on the bridge. On a 4 federators configuration, it can be 1,2,3 or 4. You should agreed on that before hand;
- FEDERATOR_KEY: the private key (PK) to your EVM wallet. It will be used to sign the transactions on the EVM;
- ETHERSCAN_KEY: a ETHERSCAN key. The federator uses it to query the blockchain for the transactions. It can be a free account;
- EVM_HOST: add your INFURA key. This is the provider use to connect to the EVM and send transactions. It also can be a free account;
- FROM_BLOCK: the initial block the federator is going to start scanning when it's up. Unless you are instructed differently, it should be the most recent one;
- HEADLESS_SEED_DEFAULT: the Hathor Wallet seed;
- HEADLESS_API_KEY: this is your wallet key. It's best to generate a new uuid, so the comunication with the federator and wallet will be secured by it;
- HEADLESS_MULTISIG_SEED_DEFAULT_PUBKEYS: this is the multisig pubkeys. The members of the multisig will exchange this information beforand
